# PSSE Technical Requirements Test S5.2.5.11
This requires two tests:
1. Frequency Grid Deadband PLB
2. Frequency Grid Droop PLB

First look at GPS requirmenets sepcified for a project. Find infomration such as 
- max operating level
- min operating level
- droop range
- deadband range

Once you have your droop range and deadband range you need to calculate the frequency variables to put into the variation dyrs.
Steps:
1. Create new dyr for each variation e.g. RevA_Droop10.dyr for 10% dyr
2. Uncomment these lines in the modify script and update dyr names:
3. Calculate the droop and and deadband variables.
Examples:
