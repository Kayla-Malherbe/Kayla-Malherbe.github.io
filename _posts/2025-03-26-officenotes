# Office Hacks

## Must haves
Always bring your
- calculator
- provided headphones
- personal headphones
- paper
- pen
- waterbottle
- ID card
- Jumper (if you get cold in aircon like me)

## WFH
Most people WFH however when you start its best to be in the office everyday because 
1. you get to know people
2. easier to ask for help and ask questions (and access IT desk)
3. The VPN slows everything down (filesharing, access, programs)
4. The offiec has such cool stuff you might as well come in
5. Plus Tom is always in so you'll never be lonely

## Personal Opinions
- three coffees a day is fine, 4 is over the top
- better to bring lunch in then you get a yap sess with your team mates
- the office is always chilly so never forget a jumper
