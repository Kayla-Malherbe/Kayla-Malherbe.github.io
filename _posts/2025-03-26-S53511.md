# Test S5.2.5.11
This test is apart of the PSSE Technical Requirements 
This requires two tests:
1. Frequency Grid Deadband PLB
2. Frequency Grid Droop PLB

First look at GPS requirmenets sepcified for a project. Find infomration such as 
- max operating level
- min operating level
- droop range
- deadband range

Once you have your droop range and deadband range you need to calculate the frequency variables to put into the variation dyrs.
Steps:
1. Create new dyr for each variation e.g. RevA_Droop10.dyr for 10% dyr
2. Uncomment these lines in the modify script and update dyr names:\

3. Calculate the droop and and deadband variables.
Examples for 50Hz Frequency:\
Deadband of 0. Four frequency points s.t. F2=F3\
![Deadband 0](/images/Deadband0.png)


$$gradient = 0.025 $$
$$ freq = 50 Hz $$
$$ f2 = f3 = freq = 50 $$
$$ f2-f1/50 = gradient = 0.025 $$ 
$$ f1 = f2 - (gradient * freq) = 48.75 $$
$$ f4 - f3 / 50 = gradient = 0.025 $$
$$ f4 = f3 + (gradient * 50) = 51.25 $$



![Deadband 0.15](/images/Deadband015.png)


$$ dB = 0.15, freq = 50, gradient = 0.025 (2.5%) $$
$$ f2 = freq - dB = 50 - 0.15 = 49.85 $$
$$ f1 = f2 - (gradient * freq ) = 48.6 $$
$$ f3 = freq + dB = 50 + 0.15 = 50.15 $$
$$ f4 = f3 + (graident * freq) = 51.4 $$



![Deadband 0.5](/images/deadband05.png)


$$ dB = 0.5, freq = 50, gradient = 0.025 (2.5%) $$
$$ f2 = freq - dB = 50 - 0.5 = 49.5 $$
$$ f1 = f2 - (gradient * freq ) = 48.25 $$
$$ f3 = freq + dB = 50 + 0.5 = 50.5 $$
$$ f4 = f3 + (graident * freq) = 51.75 $$



![Deadband 1](/images/deadband1.png)


$$ dB = 0.5, freq = 50, gradient = 0.025 (2.5%) $$
$$ f2 = freq - dB = 50 - 0.5 = 49.5 $$
$$ f1 = f2 - (gradient * freq ) = 48.25 $$
$$ f3 = freq + dB = 50 + 0.5 = 50.5 $$
$$ f4 = f3 + (graident * freq) = 51.75 $$



![Droop 2%](/images/droop2.png)


$$ dB = 0.15, freq = 50, gradient = droop = 0.02 (2%) $$
$$ f2 = freq - dB = 50 - 0.15 = 47.25 $$
$$ f1 = f2 - (gradient * freq ) = 48.25 $$
$$ f3 = freq + dB = 50 + 0.15 = 50.15 $$
$$ f4 = f3 + (graident * freq) = 51.15 $$
